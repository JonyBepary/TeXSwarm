# Additional Fixes for P2P LaTeX Collaboration Tool

This document outlines additional fixes that were implemented to address issues in the codebase.

## 1. WebSocket Message Type Consistency

Fixed issues with the WebSocket implementation to ensure consistent message types throughout the codebase:

- Replaced `tokio_tungstenite::tungstenite::Message` with `warp::ws::Message` (as `WarpMessage`) throughout the WebSocketServer implementation
- Updated all send/receive methods to use the same message type
- Properly handled message conversion for text messages

## 2. GitSync Concurrency Issues

Fixed concurrency issues in the GitSync implementation:

- Wrapped the `last_sync` HashMap in an `Arc<RwLock<_>>` to make it safely accessible from multiple tasks
- Updated methods that access the map to properly acquire read/write locks
- Fixed potential race conditions when updating synchronization timestamps

## 3. Git Integration and Repository Management

Fixed issues with the Repository interaction:

- Fixed the `has_remote` method usage by ensuring it's called on the RepositoryManager and not directly on Repository instances
- Corrected method call patterns in the GitManager for proper access to repositories

## 4. Network Event Handling and Non-Send Futures

Fixed issues with tokio tasks and non-Send futures:

- Renamed the service variable in the event loop to avoid shadowing
- Ensured proper cloning of service instances for use in async tasks
- Updated references to use the correctly cloned instances

## Remaining Issues to Address

While many issues have been fixed, some additional improvements could be made:

1. **Better Error Handling**: Add more context to error messages to make debugging easier

2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Implement more thorough unit and integration tests to verify the functionality

3. **Documentation**: Add more comprehensive documentation for the API and collaboration protocol

4. **User Experience**: Improve the client-side experience with better error messages and reconnection logic
