# Document Branch Not Found Error Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the "Document branch not found" error in the TeXSwarm LaTeX editor web client.

## Problem

Users were experiencing "Document branch not found" errors when trying to open or edit documents in the TeXSwarm LaTeX editor. This was caused by several issues:

1. Misconfiguration of ports for the API, WebSocket, and Document Persistence API
2. Lack of proper error handling for document branch errors
3. No automatic document branch creation and recovery mechanism
4. Connection issues between the web client and server components

## Solution Overview

The solution implemented addresses these issues through several complementary improvements:

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Updated connection handling to use correct ports from config.json
   - Added connection status display in the UI
   - Improved server status checking script

2. **Document Branch Error Handling**
   - Added detection of document branch errors in WebSocket messages
   - Implemented document ID extraction from error messages
   - Created functions to fix document branch issues

3. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Added automatic document branch creation
   - Implemented retry logic for document operations
   - Created status tracking for document branches

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Added status indicators for document branch status
   - Enhanced debug tools for testing and fixing document branches
   - Improved error feedback for users

## Key Components Modified

1. **document-operation-fix.js**
   - Enhanced document branch error detection
   - Added document branch status tracking
   - Implemented automatic recovery mechanisms
   - Created explicit document branch creation function

2. **new-app.js**
   - Updated document opening logic to handle branch errors
   - Enhanced WebSocket message handler for branch errors
   - Added branch status message handling

3. **new-index.html**
   - Added document branch status indicator UI
   - Added debug tools for document branch testing
   - Updated script loading order

4. **new-styles.css**
   - Added styles for document branch status indicators
   - Enhanced document info display for branch status

5. **check_server_status.sh**
   - Added document branch API status check
   - Improved server component validation

6. **test_document_branches.js**
   - Created test script to validate document branch fixes

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fixes:

1. Run `./check_server_status.sh` to ensure all server components are properly configured and running
2. Open the TeXSwarm editor using new-index.html
3. Log in to your account
4. Use the debug tools to test document branch functionality:
   - Create a test document
   - Open the document to test automatic branch creation
   - If encountering errors, use "Fix Document Branch" button
5. For advanced testing, use the test_document_branches.js script in the browser console

## Future Improvements

1. Add persistent document branch status tracking across sessions
2. Implement server-side document branch auto-creation
3. Add automatic periodic validation of document branches
4. Enhance logging for better debugging of branch-related issues

## Notes

- The document branch error handling now includes multiple redundant mechanisms to ensure errors are caught and addressed.
- The system will attempt to fix document branch issues automatically before showing errors to users.
- Debug tools are included to help developers diagnose and fix any remaining issues.
