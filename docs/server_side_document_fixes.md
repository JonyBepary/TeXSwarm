# Server-Side Document Persistence and Synchronization Fixes

This document outlines the server-side fixes implemented to address document persistence and synchronization issues in TeXSwarm. These fixes complement the client-side solutions previously implemented in the web application.

## Server-Side Components Implemented

### 1. Document Branch Manager

The `DocumentBranchManager` is a critical component that handles missing document branches, which was the root cause of the "Document branch not found" errors:

```rust
// Key features:
// - Automatic creation of missing document branches
// - Tracking of pending document requests
// - Detection and handling of "Document branch not found" errors
```

The branch manager ensures that document branches exist on all instances when needed, eliminating the common error that occurred when operating on documents.

### 2. Document Persistence Service

The `DocumentPersistenceService` provides reliable document saving mechanisms:

```rust
// Key features:
// - Automatic document saving in the background (every 5 minutes)
// - Integration with Git for version control
// - Coordination with the document branch manager
// - Manual save capabilities via API
```

This service ensures that documents are regularly saved to both local storage and Git repositories (when available), providing a complete solution for document persistence.

### 3. Enhanced WebSocket Error Handling

The WebSocket server has been updated to handle document branch errors:

```rust
// Key features:
// - Detection of "Document branch not found" errors
// - Automatic creation of missing documents
// - Retrying operations after fixing branch issues
```

These enhancements make the server resilient to document branch issues, greatly improving the reliability of document operations.

### 4. Document Persistence API

New API endpoints have been added for document persistence operations:

```
POST /api/documents/{id}/save - Save a document
GET /api/documents/{id}/check - Check if a document exists
```

These endpoints allow applications to explicitly request document saves and verify document existence, which is particularly useful for collaborative editing scenarios.

## How These Server-Side Fixes Work Together

1. **Document Branch Problem Detection**: When a document operation fails with a "Document branch not found" error, the WebSocket server now detects this specific error type.

2. **Automatic Recovery**: The document branch manager creates the missing document branch automatically.

3. **Retry Mechanism**: After creating the missing branch, the original operation is retried, making the error transparent to the user.

4. **Persistent Saving**: The document persistence service regularly saves documents to prevent data loss, both locally and to Git repositories when available.

5. **Manual Control**: Applications can also trigger saves manually through the new API endpoints, providing control over when documents are persisted.

## Git Integration Features

For documents connected to Git repositories:

1. **Automatic Synchronization**: Documents are synchronized with Git repositories at regular intervals.

2. **Import/Export**: Documents can be imported from and exported to Git repositories.

3. **Collaboration via Git**: Multiple users can collaborate on documents using Git as the synchronization backend.

## Implementation Details

### Document Branch Manager

The document branch manager handles missing document branches by:

1. Detecting "Document branch not found" errors
2. Creating missing branches with placeholder content
3. Registering pending document requests
4. Creating documents that were requested but didn't exist

### Document Persistence Service

The persistence service:

1. Maintains a record of when documents were last saved
2. Automatically saves documents at configured intervals
3. Integrates with Git for version control
4. Provides an interface for manual saving

### API Integration

The API server has been extended with:

1. New endpoints for document persistence
2. Integration with the document persistence service
3. Error handling for document persistence operations

## Future Improvements

While these fixes address the immediate document persistence and synchronization issues, future improvements could include:

1. **Conflict Resolution UI**: Add a user interface for resolving Git conflicts.
2. **Offline Editing**: Enhance support for offline editing with proper reconciliation.
3. **Document History**: Add a user interface for viewing document history and versions.
4. **Pull Request Integration**: Support for reviewing changes via Git pull requests.

## Conclusion

The server-side fixes implemented provide a robust solution to document persistence and synchronization issues in TeXSwarm. Combined with the client-side fixes already implemented, users can now:

1. Work with documents without encountering "Document branch not found" errors
2. Have their documents automatically saved at regular intervals
3. Manually save documents when needed
4. Collaborate using Git repositories for version control

These improvements make TeXSwarm a reliable LaTeX editing platform for both standalone and collaborative use cases.
