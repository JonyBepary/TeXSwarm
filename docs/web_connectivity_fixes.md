# TeXSwarm Web Connectivity Fixes

## Issue Summary

The web app was showing "Offline" status, indicating it could not connect to the backend server. This was due to several issues:

1. The server was only binding to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) instead of `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces)
2. Missing API endpoints that the web app was trying to use
3. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues in the WebSocket connection
4. Format mismatch between WebSocket client and server messages

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Server Binding Address

- Modified `server.rs` to explicitly bind to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) for both HTTP API and WebSocket server:
  ```rust
  // Force binding to all interfaces, overriding any configuration
  config.server.api_host = "0.0.0.0".to_string();
  config.server.ws_host = "0.0.0.0".to_string();
  ```
- Added detailed logging of socket addresses for easier debugging

### 2. API Endpoint Implementation

- Added a user registration endpoint at `/api/users`:
  ```rust
  let user_registration = warp::path("api")
      .and(warp::path("users"))
      .and(warp::post())
      .and(warp::body::json())
      .and_then(Self::handle_user_registration);
  ```
- Added a ping endpoint at `/api/ping` for connectivity testing
- Added proper structs for request/response handling

### 3. CORS Configuration

- Added CORS support to the WebSocket server to allow connections from web pages:
  ```rust
  .with(warp::cors()
      .allow_any_origin()
      .allow_headers(vec!["content-type", "authorization"])
      .allow_methods(vec!["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"]))
  ```

### 4. Testing Tools

- Created test scripts to verify connectivity:
  - `test_ping.sh` - Tests the HTTP API ping endpoint
  - `test_user_api.sh` - Tests the user registration endpoint
  - `test_server_connectivity.sh` - Comprehensive test of both HTTP and WebSocket servers
  - `test_ws_connection.js` - Node.js script to test WebSocket connectivity
  - Web-based test tools for browser testing

### 5. Code Cleanup

- Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes to fix compiler warnings
- Improved error handling in WebSocket message processing
- Added type checks and proper error messages for WebSocket message parsing

## Current Status

- ✅ HTTP API is accessible and responds to requests
- ✅ WebSocket server accepts connections
- ✅ User registration endpoint works correctly
- ✅ Compiler warnings have been addressed
- ✅ Ping endpoint provides quick status checks

## Next Steps

1. Test the web app in a browser with the server running
2. Update the web app's WebSocket message format if needed
3. Continue refining the API endpoints based on web app requirements
4. Implement any missing server-side functionality required by the web app
